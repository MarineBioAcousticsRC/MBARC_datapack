In addition to the raw acoustic recordings, there are several associated files for these data which include calibration files (transfer functions) and Long-term Spectral Averages (LTSAs) for sound exploration and accessibility. Three readme files provide details on the acoustic recording's xwav format, LTSA format, and transfer function descriptions. All recordings are collected in UTC. \n\nAmplitude calibration files called transfer functions are associated with the specific HARP equipment used to collect each acoustic recording dataset. Correct use of transfer functions is critical for providing absolute measured sound pressure received levels in standard acoustic measurement units, and for comparing signals within and between deployments. Transfer functions are estimates of a recording system's true sensitivity, and are being continuously evaluated and improved by Scripps Institution of Oceanography researchers and are subject to change without notice. Please review the Transfer_Function_readme before using this data.","pre_deployment_calibration_date":"2005-04-19","post_deployment_calibration_date":"2006-04-19","calibration_description":"Exact TF not available.

A HARP dataset is considered ready for analysis when XWAV and LTSA files have been generated, quality checks have been completed, and any potential errors have been noted with comments and plots associated with the deployment recordings.","quality_analysis_method":"HARPs are high-sensitivity, low noise, carefully-calibrated instruments capable of recording continuous, high-quality acoustic data over the 10 Hz to 150 kHz frequency band. Typical deployment durations range from 6 to 18 months. HARPs are continuously maintained and developed to minimize self-noise, refine calibration and improve sensitivity, ensure timing accuracy, and minimize power consumption. To ensure data are of the highest quality, multiple steps of data quality control are undertaken during data processing.  Although rare, any issues with the data are documented when observed. The processing steps and quality checks are as follows.\\n\\nHARP acoustic recordings are recovered from field equipment in compressed proprietary .hrp format. A standard HARP deployment is approximately one year in duration with recordings written on between 8 and 16 raw \\u201cdisks\\u201d of the HARP\\u2019s internal storage. After a HARP is recovered, a process is initiated to generate image files of the raw disks and decompress the recordings into XWAV format working files (see XWAV_read_me). Recording timing is checked during file header creation to identify any timing related recording errors. \\n\\nAutomated spot checks are run to extract ten randomly identified 10 second sections per disk, and these are visually examined to verify that the recordings look real (e.g. contain airgun signals or marine mammal echolocation) and confirm that there are no potential problems such as tones, system noise or hydrophone failure. Once XWAVs have been created, Long Term Spectral Averages (LTSAs, see LTSA_read_me) are generated for each raw disk. These serve as a visual index and averaged representation of the acoustic data. LTSAs are scanned visually and problems are noted in Comments if found.\\n\\nHARP recordings cover a broad range of frequencies and serve many different types of users. Recordings are not removed from the dataset unless they are determined to be entirely unusable for all cases. Issues that affect a specific frequency range are documented when observed during quality assessment steps.  Due to the large size of these datasets, quality checks are based on subsets and averages of the data, rather than a detailed review, therefore undocumented data quality issues may exist within a dataset. The user should also be aware of potential nonstandard periods in the data, which may not be documented during quality checks. These can include deck tests, used to verify that a system is working properly prior to deployment, noise related to deployment and recovery operations, and minor mooring strum. Although most HARP datasets are fully continuous, data gaps can occasionally occur, and therefore true recording effort should be verified when comparing quantities of detections over time.","quality_assessment_description":"Good","quality_entries":[{"min_frequency":20.0,"max_frequency":20000.0,"quality_level":"good","comments":"No issues reported","channel_numbers":[]}]}
